description: Amazon Dash Replenishment Service (DRS) enables connected devices to
  order physical goods from Amazon when supplies are running low&mdash;like a Brita
  Water Pitcher that orders more filters. By using Amazon Dash Replenishment, device
  makers are able to leverage Amazons authentication and payment systems, customer
  service, and fulfillment network&mdash;giving their customers access to Amazons
  low prices, great selection, and reliable delivery.
